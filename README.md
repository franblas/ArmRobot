# ArmRobot Project
The ArmRobot project aims to build and control a functional robotic arm using servo motors.
Project realized by Luc F. and Francois B. 

## The C library for STM32 card
A [C library](STM32/) has been developed to communicate with servo motors and control the arm as a whole through a STM32 electronic card.

## The Arduino library for Arduino card
An [Arduino](Arduino/) library has been developed to debug servo motors through an Arduino electronic card.
