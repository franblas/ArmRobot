# ArmRobot Project
The ArmRobot project aims to build and control a functional robotic arm using servo motors.
Project realized by Luc F. and Francois B. 

## The C library for STM32 card
A [C library](STM32/) has been developed to communicate with servo motors and control the arm as a whole through a STM32 electronic card.

## The Arduino library for Arduino card
An [Arduino](Arduino/) library has been developed to debug servo motors through an Arduino electronic card.

## Theorical code
A [Matlab](Matlab/) implementation has been done to compute equations for angles, based on the theory of Denhavit-Artenberg.

## Solidworks model
We have built the arm from scratch. [Here] (Solidworks/) you can find the whole model on solidworks we have realized, with every part of the arm.

## Joystick
Move an arm robot is cool, but with a joystick it's cooler ! [Here] (PCB_Joystick/) you can can find the pcb of the joystick, realized with Eagle.

## Project rapport
You can find the whole project rapport in pdf format [here] (https://github.com/franblas/ArmRobot/blob/master/Doc/compte_rendu_bras_de_robot.pdf?raw=true) (It's in french).
